## Abstract

This Packet Tracer project was designed to demonstrate the creation of different broadcast domains across multiple access layer switches in a 3-tier campus LAN architecture. Each VLAN was assigned a separate subnet. Each end host was configured with it’s respective IP address and a corresponding default gateway for it’s VLAN. Access layer switch ACC-SW1 was configured as the VTP server and the VLANs created forwarded to the other access layer switches configured as VTP clients (ACC-SW2, ACC-SW3, ACC-SW4), all in the same domain. The respective end host access ports were added to their respective VLANs. Next Inter-VLAN routing was configured on the layer 3 distribution switches, DIS-DW1 & DIS-SW2. FHRP was enabled on the distribution layer using HSRP in an Active/Active configuration with the interfaces for VLAN 30 and VLAN 31. The dual uplinks between the layer 3 switches were configured as port channels using the EtherChannel port aggregation protocol PAgP. OSPF was enabled on all active interfaces on all the Layer 3 devices to populate the routing tables with the optimal routes. Finally, layer 2 port security was enabled on the end host access ports creating a sticky mapping between access ports and the end host MAC addresses, with a default errdisable response if users tried to add there own devices to the network.
